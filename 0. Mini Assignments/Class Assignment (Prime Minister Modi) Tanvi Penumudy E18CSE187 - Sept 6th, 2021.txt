If I were the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India - Shri Narendra Modi, I would prioritise the semiconductor industry over the others since there is a considerable global shortage of semiconductors, which has a negative influence on the economy on so many different levels and reasons. Semiconductors have grown increasingly important in most industries, especially the automobile industry. Everything from engine computer management for improved fuel economy to advanced driver aid features like emergency braking, semiconductors play a significant role - they can considerably make or break societal progress.
